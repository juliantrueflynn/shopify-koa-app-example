# Boilerplate Koa Shopify App

This is an updated example of Shopify's repo for the Unite 2018 app walkthrough. I found the tutorial very helpful, but some of the instructions were outdated and or not working. This repo will serve to be a revamped version of their demo Shopify app walkthrough. Also, it will be extended to include Polaris setup. Please note: I'm in no way affiliated with Shopify.
